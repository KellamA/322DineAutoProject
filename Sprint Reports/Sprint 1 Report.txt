## What’s New (User Facing)
* Created database for menu
* Created menu class
* Created shopping cart class


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 1, we set up our GitHub repository and figured out how to configure our individual coding environments so that we could each code on our own, then merge our changes into one main branch when finished. At first we struggled to get the build file to work on each of our personal devices, but we learned that we had to create a separate build file for our own device in order to get the code to build properly. 


## Unfinished Work
We didn’t get to implement any front-end yet, as it would take too long for us to learn how to use it during this sprint and we wanted to focus more on making the code do what we want it to do first. We also didn’t finish user login yet, because we decided to move it to a later sprint so we can spend more dedicated time on it.

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

## Retrospective Summary
Here’s what went well:
* Using a vector for our shopping cart and order queue made it easy to continuously add new items to both the shopping cart and order queue without having to resize each
* Using a csv file to hold the completed orders allowed us to easily view the different parts of each order, such as the item name, item quantity, item ID, etc.
* Meeting up in person was a good decision as it allowed to help each other and communicate more effectively


Here’s what we’d like to improve:
* Make our individual code parts more cohesive with each other’s
* Work more on the project throughout the week instead of doing a lot of singular days
* Try to meet up more in person in order to make sure everyone is on the same page
* Start on the next sprint earlier so we have more time to ask questions and debug our code


Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Make use of office hours when we’re stuck in order to get ideas on what to do/how to fix existing code
* Gradually shift from text-based to more visual-focused
* Start to implement code for Revenue Tracker and other statistics-based functions
