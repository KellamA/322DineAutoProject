# Sprint 3 Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * User can now see their name and total price of their shopping cart displayed in order queue
 * User now has an interface they can interact with when placing a new order

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 3, we completed work on the front end side of our project, reworked the orderDataBase to now also include the order name and total price of the shopping cart when writing to the orders.csv file, reformatted the Order Queue to also include order name and total price, redid other parts of the code to align with the new formatting of the orders.cdv files, and did overall debugging of the entire program.

## Unfinished Work
We didnâ€™t get to implement a system for the user to choose whether they want their food to be dine-in or to-go, because we deemed this task to be of low importance compared to other more essential tasks and ran out of time to implement it in the end. We also didn't get to implement a system for the user to login using a set username and password, because we deemed this task to be too complex and not essential enough to the rest of our program to dedicate too much time to and risk not finishing more important parts of our code.

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:
 * https://github.com/KellamA/322DineAutoProject/blob/main/main.cpp
 * https://github.com/KellamA/322DineAutoProject/blob/main/analytics.cpp
 * https://github.com/KellamA/322DineAutoProject/blob/main/orderDataBase.cpp
 * https://github.com/KellamA/322DineAutoProject/blob/main/menu.cpp

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
 * Making the orders.csv file have a consistent formatting made it easier when having to parse data from the file in other functions
 * Having the menu class contain a shopping cart made it easier to access elements of that shopping cart later to use in other functions

Here's what we'd like to improve:
 * Should we have been able to redo this project over again, we would've used Python instead of C++, as Python is more efficient to use in regards to creating graphics the user can interact with

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
 * This is the final sprint!
